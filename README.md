# FitSwipe - Outfit Recommendation App

**FitSwipe** is a mobile fashion discovery app where users swipe through individual clothing items from different brands.
Users can **swipe right** to like items, swipe **left** to skip them, or add selected pieces to a **shopping bag**, where they can view the total price of the selected items. 
The app offers categories like **Dress**, **Jackets**, **Coats| Trench Coats**, **Blazers**, and **T-Shirts** etc. for men, women and children.

## Setup & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK **3.22 or higher**
* Android Studio or VS Code (with Flutter extensions)
* Firebase account
* Android emulator or physical device

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeynepbilici/CS310-TERM-PROJECT.git
cd CS310-TERM-PROJECT-main
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Firebase Configuration

* Create a Firebase project from the Firebase Console
* Enable **Email/Password Authentication**
* Enable **Cloud Firestore**
* Download Firebase configuration files:

  * `google-services.json` → `android/app/`
  * `GoogleService-Info.plist` → `ios/Runner/`

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
flutter run
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Test Coverage

The project includes the following tests:

1. **Unit Test - Product Model** (`test/models/product_test.dart`):
   - Tests Product model's `fromFirestore` method for correct JSON parsing
   - Tests Product model's `toMap` method for correct map conversion
   - Tests backward compatibility for price fields (minPrice/maxPrice → price)
   - Uses `FakeFirebaseFirestore` and `MockDocumentSnapshot` for isolated testing

2. **Widget Test - Swipe Screen** (`test/widgets/swipe_test.dart`):
   - Verifies that swipe screen displays all required UI elements
   - Tests presence of like button (heart icon)
   - Tests presence of dislike button (close icon)
   - Tests presence of bag button (shopping bag icon)
   - Tests presence of "FitSwipe" title
   - Uses Dependency Injection with `FakeProductService`, `FakeProductProvider`, and `FakeCartProvider` to avoid Firebase initialization

All tests must pass successfully. If any test fails, check:
- All dependencies are installed (`flutter pub get`)
- Test files are properly configured with mocks
- No actual Firebase calls are made during testing

## Known Limitations & Bugs

- **None currently**: All features are stable and tested. The app works end-to-end without crashes.

## Firebase Security Rules

The app uses Firestore security rules to ensure user data privacy:
- Users can only access their own favorites, dislikes, and cart
- Products are readable by all authenticated users
- Only product creators can modify their products
- Admin products are marked with `isAdminProduct: true` for swipe functionality

See `firestore.rules` for complete rules.

---

## Firestore Data Structure

```
users/
  {uid}/
    - uid: string
    - email: string
    - createdAt: timestamp
    - updatedAt: timestamp
    favorites/ (subcollection)
      {productId}/
        - product data
    dislikes/ (subcollection)
      {productId}/
        - product data
    cart/ (subcollection)
      {productId}/
        - product data
        - quantity: number

products/
  {productId}/
    - name, price, imageUrl, category, gender, etc.
    - isAdminProduct: boolean
```

---

## Architecture & Design Decisions

- **Provider Pattern** was chosen for scalable and testable state management
- **Firestore subcollections** were used to isolate user data and simplify security rules
- **Dark mode persistence** was implemented using SharedPreferences instead of Firestore to reduce read costs

---

## User Flow

1. User signs up / logs in
2. Lands on Swipe Screen
3. Swipes right/left or adds item to bag
4. Views product details if interested
5. Manages favorites, dislikes and shopping bag
6. Checks profile statistics in settings

---

## Ethical & Privacy Considerations

- No personal data other than email is stored
- All user data is protected with Firestore security rules
- Users can only access their own favorites, dislikes and cart
- No third-party tracking or analytics is used
